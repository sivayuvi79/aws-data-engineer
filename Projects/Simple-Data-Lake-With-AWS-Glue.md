## Project Objective

This project demonstrates how to build a simple data lake using AWS services. The data lake leverages Amazon S3 as the primary storage solution for raw JSON files. Here's what you'll accomplish:

1. **Data Transformation**: Use AWS Glue ETL to transform raw JSON files into a structured format.
2. **Data Storage**: Store the processed data back into the same S3 bucket.
3. **Metadata Management**: Utilize AWS Glue crawlers to populate the Glue Data Catalog with metadata about the processed data.
4. **Data Querying**: Query the data using SQL statements in Amazon Athena.

### Optional Exploration
Discover the impact of **compression** and **partitioning** on data storage and query performance in Amazon S3.

By the end of this project, you'll gain hands-on experience with AWS Glue, Amazon S3, and Amazon Athena, enabling you to build and optimize data lakes effectively.
